# format    ------------------>

 V=         - select text, then reformat with =
 =          - will correct alignment of code
 ==         - one line; 

 >>           Indent line by shift-width spaces
 <<           De-indent line by shift-width spaces
 5>>          Indent 5 lines
 5==          Re-indent 5 lines

 >%           Increase indent of a braced or bracketed block (place cursor on brace first)
 =%           Re-indent a braced or bracketed block (cursor on brace)
 <%           Decrease indent of a braced or bracketed block (cursor on brace)
 ]p           Paste text, aligning indentation with surroundings

 =i{          Re-indent the 'inner block', i.e. the contents of the block
 =a{          Re-indent 'a block', i.e. block and containing braces
 =2a{         Re-indent '2 blocks', i.e. this block and containing block

 >i{          Increase inner block indent
 <i{          Decrease inner block indent


normal mode:

    >>  right indent one shift-width
    <<  left indent

insert mode:

CTRL+SHIFT+T:   right indent
CTRL+SHIFT+D:   left indent

Options to change how automatic formatting is done:

:set formatoptions (default "tcq")
                 t - textwidth
                 c - comments (plus leader -- see :help comments)
                 q - allow 'gq' to work
                 n - numbered lists
                 2 - keep second line indent
                 1 - single letter words on next line
                 r - (in mail) comment leader after
